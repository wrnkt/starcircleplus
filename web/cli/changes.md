Add Type enum to Entry.
Create private type identifier for an Entry instance.

Add new getters and setters.

NOTE:
I did't force assignment of entryType because I dont think it's really necessary.



how can I make a data structure associating values and the way they need to change with other values? For example, if I want to change the boolean value checked based off of the enum entryType.
